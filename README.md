# Capstone-Project-EDA
This is the first Capstone Project in which I have done some exploratory data analysis and some data-visualization.
I have performed exploratory data analysis over the Hotel Booking data and then find some insights that might be useful for the customers or
the hotels.
Initially, I did the data wrangling which included the cleaning of data like
handling the null values or removing the duplicate records from the data.
After completing the data cleaning operations, we performed some basic graphs
over the different columns which were provided to us to obtain some hidden
information. 
Some basic python libraries that helped us to do all the operations
were NumPy and Pandas. 
For the visualization, we have used libraries like Matplotlib
and Seaborn which help us visualize the pandas data frame in form of multiple
graphs.
