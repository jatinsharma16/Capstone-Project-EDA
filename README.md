# Capstone-Project-EDA
We are provided with the hotel booking data ranging from the period 1 July 2015 to 31 August 2017. We are required to do exploratory data analysis over the data and then find some insights that might be useful for the customers or the hotels. Initially, we did the data wrangling which included the cleaning of data like handling the null values and removing the duplicate records from the data. After completing the data cleaning operations, we performed some basic visualizations over the different columns which were provided to us to know some hidden information. Some basic python libraries that helped us to do all the operations are NumPy and Pandas. For the visualization, we have used libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn which helped us visualize the pandas data frame in form of multiple graphs. 

We tried to obtain some useful insights from the hotel booking data to help hotels and make them understand what are the trends of customers and what are the preferences of the customer. We tried to find out multiple trends like the type of hotel preferred or the rooms that are reserved by the guests, what type of food is ordered by the guests, what are the average stay length of guests, or what type of guests contributes to the most in bookings and many other questions.

We started the project by doing some univariate analysis, plotting graphs on single-column values, then we made comparisons between the two hotel types. Then we analyzed the distribution channels or the market segments and finally, we tried to conclude what results in special requests made by a client or what are the average ADR w.r.t. months and other complex questions. 

Some of the useful insights that are found during the project are:
- City hotels are preferred over Resort hotels. 
- Transient-type customers contribute the most to bookings. 
- Room 'A' is preferred by the majority of guests and their favorite meal type is 'BB'. 
- The waiting time for a City hotel is much more than that of a Resort hotel. 
- In terms of average ADR, online TA is the biggest contributor among the market segments whereas GDS is the biggest among the distribution channels. 
- The peak hotel booking periods are the months of July and August whereas the ADR is the maximum in August. 
- The average stay length is around 10 days. 
- The reason for special requests belongs to adults as well as the ADR.

Finally, these are all conclusions that are made and will help the hotel owners to understand their customers more and provide better facilities to their guests.
